# Mundoko Maps

Join me as I map the city at the centre of my fantasy world, Mundoko.

## Why

1. The story-telling and gameplay benefits from a consistent setting
2. I enjoy drawing maps and building this world from my imagination
3. You might like to share knowledge on approaches to mapping a game world

## What

- [x] **Pathfinder** and **Dungeons & Dragons** compatible scales (5' squares, feet and miles)
- [x] Well considered grid and co-ordinate system
- [ ] Millions of handdrawn maps, from extra-global scale right down to floorplans

## Notes

1. This is a work in progress that may never be finished
1. Aside from drawing the maps I want to build software that brings it all together
1. I start simple and add tools and other complexities once their necessity is clear

### System Context

![C4 Model - Tile Maker – Context](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/353044/143956399-ca462c6b-a0a8-49f6-9bf8-ec7696c681c1.jpg)

_☝️ Here I've named three systems – Mundoku Maps, Tile Enhancer and Tile Maker. The Tile Maker is the most unusual of the three. I see it receiving a small scale map tile and auto-generating all the larger scale tiles that would be needed to cover the same area. That sounds like the next thing to build/diagram/document._
