# 🧙🏾‍♀️ Mundoku Maps 🗺

Hand made, automagical technology for mapping a fantasy city

ℹ️ **Pre-alpha** means this really isn't ready for public use but we'd love collaboration 👍

---

## Why 🧮 👩‍🎨 🪐

1. Story based games benefits from half decent maps and _locational consistency_
2. Personally I love drawing maps and creating an imaginary world 
3. Open-source means we can share knowledge, resources and all that good stuff 

## What 🐉 ⚔️ 🎲

- [x] **Pathfinder** and **Dungeons & Dragons** compatible units and scales
- [x] A highly opinionated grid, scale, co-ordinate and page size system
- [ ] Millions of map tiles, from extra-global scale right down to floorplans

## Notes 📝 👨🏿‍💻 🔭

1. This is a work in progress that may never be finished
1. The intention here is to build software that supports people who want to hand-draw maps of their imaginary worlds
1. This system is designed to be compatible with [Pathfinder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathfinder_Roleplaying_Game) and may well translate to [Dungeons & Dragons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeons_%26_Dragons) and other table top RPGs

### System Context

Here's a picture to help visualise who will use this "system" and how the different parts of it interact with one another.

![C4 Model - Tile Maker – Context](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/353044/143956399-ca462c6b-a0a8-49f6-9bf8-ec7696c681c1.jpg)

_☝️ Here I've named three systems – Mundoku Maps, Tile Enhancer and Tile Maker. The Tile Maker is the most unusual of the three. I see it receiving a small scale map tile and auto-generating all the larger scale tiles that would be needed to cover the same area. That sounds like the next thing to build/diagram/document._ 

None of this has been built yet. It's still in the early days of ideation.
