# Mundoko Maps

Join me as I map the city at the centre of my fantasy world, Mundoko.

## Why

1. It provides the spaces within which the stories of my world take place
1. Others might want to share knowledge on how we map our game worlds
1. I enjoy drawing maps and creating this place

## What

- [x] **Pathfinder** and **Dungeons & Dragons** compatible scales (5' squares, feet and miles)
- [x] Well considered grid and co-ordinate system
- [ ] Millions of handdrawn maps, from global scale right down to floorplans

## Notes

1. This is a work in progress that may never be finished
1. Aside from drawing the maps I want to build software that brings it all together
1. I start simple and adding tools and other complexities once their necessity is clear
