# 🧙🏾‍♀️ Mundoko Maps 🗺

Hand made, automagical technology for mapping a fantasy city

---
ℹ️ **Pre-alpha** means this really isn't ready for public use but we'd love collaboration 👍

---

## Why 🧮 👩‍🎨 🪐

1. Story based games benefits from half decent maps and _locational consistency_
2. Personally I love drawing maps and creating an imaginary world 
3. Open-source means we can share knowledge, resources and all that good stuff 

## What 🐉 ⚔️ 🎲

- [x] **Pathfinder** and **Dungeons & Dragons** compatible units and scales
- [x] A highly opinionated grid, scale, co-ordinate and page size system
- [ ] Millions of map tiles, from extra-global scale right down to floorplans

## Notes 📝 👨🏿‍💻 🔭

1. This is a hobby project, practicing async, laid-back communication
1. The intention here is to build software that supports people who want to hand-draw maps of their imaginary worlds
1. This system is designed to be compatible with [Pathfinder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathfinder_Roleplaying_Game) and may well translate to [Dungeons & Dragons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeons_%26_Dragons) and other table top RPGs

### Tech Vision

A couple of pictures to help visualise who will use this tech and how the different parts of it will interact with one another

None of this has been built yet. It's still in the early days of ideation.
